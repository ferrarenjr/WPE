            <h1>FEEDING PROGRAM</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> on November 12 2024, at 9 in the morning, at Sibulan central elementary school we were feeding the kindergarten students, I attended this program as a sub organizer. 
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> Because of this event I was able to use my cooking skills and was able to help my team. While I was at the school I was able to talk to some of the kids and made friends with them. The kids were very precious since they were still so young and their minds are still so innocent.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This experience helped me to become more caring for the community because I was able to see the kids who needed me, seeing them listen to me and look up to me really made me realize that I should be doing better so that I can be a good role model to them
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I will put more effort in myself so kids will look up to me and look to me as a role model.
