            <h1>DING IBATO</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> on November 13 2024, at 3 In the afternoon at the Ravello ball field, together with me were students from CCS and students that joined the games who were from another college, this event was organized by DOSTsaSU, one of my friends is a part of DOST so he was the one who told me about this. The game they played was dodgeball and since dodgeball isnâ€™t a really popular game it was all equally fair to all the players since no one was a professional dodgeball player.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> Because of this event I saw those students who were apart of DOST and got to know more about DOST, I expected this game to be fun and it turned out to actually be more fun than I expected, everyone had a great time together, especially the players.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This activity brought together students from CCS and students from other colleges together, and while doing that this activity was a fun physical activity so it was a fun workout for the players, while having fun they were connecting with each other.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I made more friends with other students and got to know more about DOST.
