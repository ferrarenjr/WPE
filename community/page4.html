            <h1>DONATION DRIVE FOR BATA NG CALABNUGAN</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On Dec 4 2024 at 3:00 in the afternoon, me and my team went to the Calabnugn orphanage called “Bata ng calabnugan”, while we were there we were able to meet all of the volunteers there and the workers and the kids, the kids were the main reason we were there, we did all of this for the kids. We were then given a tour of the orphanage and  we even got to meet the founder of the orphanage.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I didn’t know what to expect during this activity, but I had a nice time meeting the kids and the founder of the orphanage, very nice and acomodating people.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This experience helped me to realize that there are kids that are lacking in many things, even the things they need, and I am super blessed to have everything that I have right now.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I have come to realize that I am super fortunate to have everything I have right now and I will keep helping those that need it.
