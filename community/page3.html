            <h1>BREAST CANCER AWARENESS: FUN RUN</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On October 13 2024, at Pantawan peoples park, I participated in a fun run for breast cancer awareness which I payed to enter. I joined the 10k run and went to the park at 4:00am to get there early, during the run it was going well, few water stops during the run and light traffic since it was still pretty early in the morning, on the way to the finish line there were a lot of people watching and supporting us runners.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I expected to get tired early in the run but prior to the run I was training every day in preparation for this run, but during the race I only took a few breaks and finished the run in 1 hour.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This experience helped me to get more into shape and more active, also I was able to help a good cause since this run was for breast cancer awareness.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I was able to get active and help a good cause and join a community of runners.
