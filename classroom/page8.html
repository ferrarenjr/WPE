            <h1>ROTC PRESENTATION OF SPONSORS</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On November 16 2024, at 3:00 in the afternoon the SUROTC was having a presentation of sponsors, I am an MP in the SUROTC and I was assigned at the RTY gate, I was uncharge of letting the VIP guests inside of the ballfield. Throughout the whole event I was stationed at the gate, while all of the other cadets were forming and marching.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> during the event whenever a VIP guest would enter I would have to give them a salute and greet them with good afternoon, for the entirety of the event I was staying at the RTY gate and my fellow MPâ€™s were stationed at other parts of the ball field.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This experience changed my perspective on all of the different roles in a military base, it really showed me that everyone has different jobs and everyone is working.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I have practiced my patience in staying in a place doing nothing for long amounts of time, like a guard I was watching the RTY gate and helping guests come into the ball
