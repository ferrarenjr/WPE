            <h1>Millers Solutions Development: Designing user experience key UI/UX strategies</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On August 22 2024, at 8:30 in the morning, at the ATA hall there was a lecture being held by 2 speakers, this lecture was about user interface and user experience.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I expected this lecture to be a lecture that talked about things that all CCS student already know, but the speakers were very smart and made the room atmosphere a nice one. They talked about their jobs and how it can be hard and easy at times, they showed us a powerpoint presentation which was very informative and had really nice designs, since they were UI/UX workers. They then had an activity where they would let us design an app like google maps and they let us design the UI/UX and they made us add a feature that no other navigating app had.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This activity made me understand more about UI/UX and made me want to focus more on the UI/UX on my future projects.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am more attentive to the UI/UX in my future projects.
