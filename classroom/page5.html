            <h1>UNIVERSITY-WIDE ORIENTATION</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On September 11 2024, at 9:00 in the morning, in the Luce auditorium there was a University-wide Orientation, this orientation was for freshman and new students, I was a freshman. In this orientation we were taught the laws and services Silliman had, thanks to this we freshies and new students are now informed and ready to study at Silliman.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I thought this orientation would be just like every other orientation at any other school, but Silliman Is different, Silliman is packed with things that have certain rules, and things that make the quality of studying here even better. In the middle of the orientation a speaker talked about sexual harassment, here is where I learned that Silliman takes sexual harassment very seriously, which it should be, this is just another thing that Silliman does right. 
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This orientation helped me understand all of the things Silliman has to offer, it showed me that Silliman University really cares about their students and puts their studies at the very top.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am grateful to be a Silliman student and I have learned all the things needed to know about this university.
