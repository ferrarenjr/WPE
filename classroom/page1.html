            <h1>Millers Solutions Development: web development: latest trends and strategies</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On august 19, 2024, at 2:00 in the afternoon at the ATA hall in the Uytengsu building there was a “balk talent” lecture that was being held. I attended this lecture  as a participant. This lecture was about the latest trends in web development and how we could use them in our studies or just to know.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I expected this lecture to be just another lecture where it’s all talking and it wouldn’t be interesting, but since this speaker was an alumni from Silliman Universitys CCS, I found it interesting because it was something that relates to every single one of us in that room. The speakers showed important aspects of AI and how AI works, the lecture was mostly(not entirely) about AI since AI has become a big trend nowadays.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This activity taught me how to properly use AI, how AI works/thinks, and uses of AI. I will be able to use this newfound knowledge in the future when I come across AI in my learnings. 
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am now more interested and more knowledgeable about AI and how it works.
