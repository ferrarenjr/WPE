            <h1>Balik talent lecture: Big Data and IoT: Why They Matter in Innovation</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On August 20 2024, at 8:30 in the morning, at the ATA hall they were holding another balik talent lecture, I attended the lecture as a participant and together with me was my fellow CCS peers.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> This lecture was very informative, this is the reason why I like these kinds of lecture because even when you think you know everything, there is always something you don’t know, so during this lecture the speaker talked about topics like big data and Iot, I didn’t even know the meaning of these before I entered this lecture. The speaker is a very smart programmer, they talked about their project at their job, they were working abroad which really opened my mind in job locations in my field. With everything the speaker talked about it really was informative and interesting.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This lecture helped me understand big data and IoT and made me think about how I could use these in future projects. 
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am now more interested in big data and IoT. And I am more interested in learning more about these topics.
