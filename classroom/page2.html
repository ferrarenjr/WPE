            <h1>VOLUNTEERING NETWORK PROGRAM</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On November 13 2024, 1:00 in the afternoon, in the PEP room on the 3rd floor of the OH building in Silliman University, the SUSG was holding a volunteering network program where they were looking for volunteers who will be able to help them in activities in the future. During my time in that room there were speakers who talked about their past volunteering experiences and the things that you should do as a volunteer, then we started to play games like 4 pics 1 word, and they continued to talk about volunteerism.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I thought this activity would be all about volunteerism and I was right, it was mainly focused on volunteerism simply because it was a volunteering network program. One memorable moment in this activity was when the speaker was talking about their past experiences about going to a place where there were kids who had nothing to eat but they were still the happiest kids on the street, the speaker said that they are the reason they do what they do, for the kids, and that moment really touched me.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This activity taught me that I am very lucky to have everything I have right now and I should be giving more of my time and energy to those who need it.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am now inspired to volunteer to help those in need.
