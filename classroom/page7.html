            <h1>GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING GROUP DYNAMICS ACTIVITY</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On August 20 2024, at 3:00pm in ATA hall, I attended a guidance and counseling group dynamics activity, there with me were a few fellow CCS students, the reason why we were so little was because we werenâ€™t able to join the first guidance and counseling group activity the day before, so we just joined the next available one. In this activity we played some games and got to know each other.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I was a participant, and me and my fellow CCS students were playing games, we played this game where we would evolve from one animal to another if we won a rock paper scissors game agains another classmate that was the same animal as you. After playing that game we were shown a video about beginning a new life starting college, then the guidance counselor asked us questions and made us fill up a form about us.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> Because of these activities, I am friends with more of my fellow CCS students, and I now know where to go to if I am having a hard time with life.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am more cautious about how I let my mental health control my life.
