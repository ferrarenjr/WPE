            <h1>CCS DEVOTION</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On August 19 2024, 7:30 in the morning, in Silliman church it was the opening week of hibalag, and CCS was holding an opening devotion, and I was there as a participant. There I joined my CCS peers in a gathering that was important to our college and to our faith.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> It was my first time going into the Silliman church so it was a new experience for me, I expected nothing out of the ordinary since it was just an opening devotion. The speaker there was Rev. Iris H. Tibus, and listening to what they had to say really impacted me as a student, classes just started and im starting new, so this speech was very important to me since it explained everything I need to know about CCS and what it means to be a CCS student. They gave another meaning to CCS, it now didn’t only mean “College of Computer Studies” but now it means Committing all plans and activities to God, Connecting with God in prayer, and Surrendering all glory and credit to God. This new meaning to CCS will now stay with me forever since it will always remind me about keeping my faith in God and how He will always be by my side throughout my journey.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This experience changed the way I look at my challenges in life, now I know that all challenges in life are conquerable with God by your side, keeping your faith in Him will always help you, and by letting Him guide us we will be able to achieve what we are meant to achieve. This was an activity that I needed, because since I was still pretty nervous from class just starting, these words and this activity really reminded me to put all my faith in God and He will lead us even if we are struggling 
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am now who I am today, I put all faith in God which led to me to become stronger and more confident which is helping me to become better than ever.
