            <h1>CONVOCATION</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On October 14 2024, 10:00 in the morning, at Silliman universitys Luce auditorim, a convocation was being held, I was there as a participant and I was seated outside because the seats inside were full, but it was okay since there was a tv placed outside and chairs for us to sit in while we watch a live video stream of what was ongoing in the Luce auditorium. During this convocation it was said that Silliman University has full autonomous status. 
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I expected to get bored from listening to this event but in reality it was a pretty interesting event that talked about the state of Silliman and its plans in the future, this was glad to here since I know Silliman is already a great school and it is still working on its self to become even greater. I used this and reflected on myself, seeing that Silliman is already a great school and is still trying to better itself, I thought to also put myself in that kind of movement, even if I donâ€™t think of myself as that great I would still want to make myself better. 
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This experience helped me reflect in myself to become someone who will always be improving their self even if they already are great. Seeing how Silliman is a high status school and they are still working to make it even a higher quality school inspires me to do the same for myself.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, - Because of this activity I want to make myself a better person and to always keep improving myself.
