            <h1>PSALM READING</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On October 16 2024, 6:00 in the afternoon, at the Dumaguete Refuge Church, the group PSALM Dumaguete was holding a psalm reading event, and we were on the book of James, I was there as a participant, listening to the explanation to to story and why the story related to the world today. We were then grouped into 3 members and we were to talk about our experiences of “evil tongue” (since that was the topic of the book of James), and I talked about my experiences and the other members of my group also shared their experiences, and the person at PSALM talked to us about our experiences saying that we all have an evil tongue since no one is perfect, but its better to think before we speak. 
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> This was my first time joining this type of activity so I was pretty scared, but the people of PSALM Dumaguete are so friendly and they were also some students of Silliman University, I was expecting to just listen to what the speaker had to say about the story and for him to give a reflection, but this activity really made sure that everybody had a part in it. The people of PSALM Dumaguete are the nicest people I have aver met, it made me happy to be surrounded by people who will accept you for who you are. Being there at that moment and after leaving made me feel like a brand new person, it gave me motivation and the will to keep doing good and to spread the word of God.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This activity turned me into a nicer person, being surrounded by nice people inspired me to be the nicest version of myself, this experience will help me keep my faith in God and help me remember that there is still good in the world and it is my job to help spread it. Spreading the word of God and being a good faithful christian will keep me involved with this group even if I am not with them all the time
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, - Because of this activity I have more faith in God and the people of the world, I am to remember that I should always be nice and respect others to also be respected.
