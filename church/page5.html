            <h1>SUNDAY MASS</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On September 1 2024, at 4:00 in the afternoon, at the Sta. Catalina de Alejandría parish I attended a Sunday mass, it was an ordinary Sunday mass, it was a moment where i was able to reflect on my spiritual growth and reconnect with god, the homily showed the importance of having faith in gods plan, reminding us that we should face our problems with courage and perseverance. being inside the church made me feel at peace and helped my connect with others in worship. it was a moment where i could take a break and realign my values with god
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> This is something I don't get to do as often. Since I moved out of my old home with my family, I haven’t been able to visit the church in a while compared to before moving out where I would go to mass every Sunday. But this Time I was able to find some time and attend the Sunday mass. this was a needed activity for me because I have been so stressed and I really needed to reconnect with god and what better place than the church to do so.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This experience helped me reconnect with God and helped me to remember  to put all of my faith and trust in god so that all of my hardships in life will be worth it because of God.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am reconnected with God and I am stronger regarding my faith.
