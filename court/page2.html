            <h1>PASIKLABAN</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On October 30 2024, 3:00 in the afternoon, at the Silliman gym I was present in a pasiklaban game that the SHS of silliman were having. I watched a volleyball game they were having and it was very nice to see how all of the teams had their own support and cheer squads, this shows that each team really cares about their teammates, and its clear that they aren’t playing sports to win but instead to have fun, seeing the looks on their faces made it seem clear that it was all for fun. 
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> These games show camaraderie and teamwork among the teams, it shows that they don’t care if they win or lose all they care about Is having fun and being there for their team. The teams stayed respectful to the other teams and showed good sportsmanship. This showed the true purpose of these sporting event, to bring people together and to have fun.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This experience taught me to not be so serious and to start enjoying what I do, seeing all of the teams supporters reminded me of the people I have supporting me, which inspired me to do more and to do better.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I remembered all the people who are supporting me which inspires me to do better.
