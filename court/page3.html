            <h1>ML TOURNAMENT</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On October 30, at the Guy hall in Silliman university, I was attending a ML tournament among SHS student of Silliman university. The tournament had many different teams with many different playing styles and different ways they treat their team. Some were really aggressive while some were really cooperative with their team. The games showed the different ways teams work with each other.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> The games showed that the players put a lot of effort into playing this game that they love, some of them might have lost but they are still playing the game that they love. The games showed how teams work with each other and impressed me with their skills in this game, it’s obvious to see that they are very skilled in this type of game.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> The players showed me that even if you lose it’s okay to lose, because losing means your getting closer to winning. The games showed that if you work well with your team and if you and your team have the same goal and are focused on that goal you can achieve anything. 
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am going to be more focused on my goals and remember to always respect everyone.
