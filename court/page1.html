            <h1>KAGAWAD JASON LAGAHIT CUP: 2ND BASKETBALL CONFERENCE</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On November 14 2024, at 6:00 In the afternoon, I went to the Lamberto Macias sports complex to watch the 2nd basketball conference in the KJLC, there wasn’t much people in the audience, many teams were playing and each team showed proper teamwork and sportsmanship.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> Watching these games made me understand the importance of trusting your team whenever playing sports. When playing sports like basketball it’s not only about scoring and winning, but it’s about trusting your team and respecting the other teams, because that is true sportsmanship. You could tell by the way the teams played that the players truly love the sport and play it for their passion of the sport.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> - These games have inspired me to put all my effort into the things im passionate about, when I do the things I love I should give my 100% and love what im doing. Seeing this in the players gave me a feeling that if I put everything I have into everything I do, then I can do anything without any problems, if I just believe in myself and never give up.
                
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am inspired to put my 100% in everything I do.
