            <h1>ROBLOX CAR SHOW</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On December 15 2024 at 10 in the evening the CCS sports committee hosted the 1st ever Roblox car show and I participated bringing my own car with me, the tournament was fully online and we were able to use any car of our choice, modify it how ever we want, the only constraint they had was that it needed to be under 10million. My car was a red GTR that i modified to my liking.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I expected to see many nice cars from my friends and fellow CCS students and I did see many cars, each had their own personality, it was very evident that every player put a lot of effort into designing their car.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This activity brought CCS together because it was something we could all enjoy even for those who arenâ€™t into cars, but during this event everyone had a good time and we all made fun memories.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am closer to my fellow CCS students.
