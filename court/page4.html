            <h1>3RD KIND DANCE SPORT</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On Nov 15 2024, at 8:00pm, at the pantawan peoples park I attended a dance sport competition and watched as dancers had a performance with a partner for a few minutes each, they only had a few minutes to showcase their skills but even In those few minutes you could see the skill and the effort that they put into their dancing.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> This competition showed dedication to the sport from the dancers, it is very impressive how we humans can move our body and it conveying a meaning, every movement the dancers made it was clear that they put a lot of practice and effort behind it.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> They showed beauty in the sport of dancing, showed that dancing isnâ€™t only how you move your body but the reason behind the dances is what this is all for.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am more appreciative of dancers showing and telling their story and emotions through their dances.
