            <h1> FPBC BASKET BALL TOURNAMENT</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On December 8 2024, at 8:00 in the morning, at the Daro gym, I attended a basketball tournament that was between CCS students, a couple of teams played against each other and it showed a great case of teamwork, it was a fun tournament because it was between the people I am together with most of my days. And the players enjoyed competing because they all had the same goal to have fun and to not just focus on winning
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> The games between fellow CCS students showcased great teamwork even against the other team, there was respect and camaraderie. This is what every tournament should be like, just having fun with people you respect.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> They showed the beauty of the sport, since they all worked together and all respect each other enough to not be playing against each other but instead with each other.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, the students of CCS are now more connected and close with each other.
