            <h1>HIBALAG: MR. HIBALAG</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On August 28 2024 at the hibalag grounds I attended the Mr. Hibalag event with my friend and we watched the show while we ate at the stalls around us. The show was very nice since the contestants were all equally worthy of the Mr Hibalag crown and they all worked hard to achieve it.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I expected this show to be just like every other pageant where it would be ordinary contestants, but this show was different since the contestants were from the different colleges of silliman, and all of the contestants were super talented and all deserved the crown, all did their best and made their mark in the schools history.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> It was a good show since it was founders week and I was surrounded by people from other colleges as well as people from my college.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I was able to experience Hibalag
