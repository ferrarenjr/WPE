            <h1>TONE KEY QUARTET</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On August 21 2024, at 7:00pm in the Luce auditorium, I attended the tone key quartet. During the performance there were many parts that had different genres, yet every part was perfectly preformed. During one of the parts the percussionist whore a horse mask which was very entertaining, the percussionist was the highlight of the show because during another part of the show the music was “phantom of the opera” and the percussionist wore a phantom costume and went around the auditorium.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> This performance was very entertaining, it was a very memorable night and it was one of the nights that will pop up in my mind every time I would think of my time at silliman university
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This show has left a memorable experience for me and will make me look forward to future shows in the Luce auditorium.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I now have an experience In the Luce auditorium.
