            <h1>ISLAND MADNESS 3: CAR SHOW</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On October 12 2024, at Freedom park, Dumaguete I attended the Island madness 3: car show, and there I saw very nice and very clean motorcycle and lots of modded cars, ive always had an interest in modified cars since I was a little kid, so I was very keen on the cars in this show. Walking around they were also having activities relating to the vehicles like revving the car and other things. A judge was there to judge the cars on their looks and performance. 
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> This was a very cool showcase of cars and motorcycles because they were cars that we see regularly on the road here in Dumaguete but you could tell that they were modded and well taken car of.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This showcase was a fun experience because of all the people I met and the cars I saw, it showed the beauty of the car community here in Dumaguete.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I was able to see nice cars with nice modifications and meet nice people in the car community
