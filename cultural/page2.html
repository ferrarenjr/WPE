            <h1>FRESHIE WALK</h1>
            <p> 
                <b>What?:</b> On August 15 2024, at 1:00 in the after noon, the all of the freshman from CCS gathered at the ballfield and we walked across campus and met all the other colleges at the amphitheater. During this activity I was the one holding a banner for CCS and I felt proud to represent my college. I felt a great sense of community seeing all of the other freshmanâ€™s walking together celebrating their new found communities.
                <br><br><b>So what?:</b> I thought this activity would be just a parade-like event, but when we gathered at the amphitheater we had activities which helped us to be more interactive with each other. This is the activity that changed my view on silliman, seeing all of the other freshies and all of the other people In the parade made me love my school even more seeing the tightly knit community this school has.
                <br><br><b>Now what?:</b> This activity showed the beauty of community and helped the freshies grow more comfortable with each other and the school.
                <br><br><b>Because of this activity</b>, I am more connected with my fellow freshies and am a part of this community.
